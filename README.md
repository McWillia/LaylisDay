# LaylisDay

## Concept
So basically this project is an idea I had where you use a web application to give tasks to someone in real life. So instead of a video game where you would complete tasks in the game to advance the story you do tasks in real life that the orginiser has set up to let the player advance through the web app.

This project is weird and I am not sure how to go about implementing it. I'll try to use this as a diary for implementation and I will try to make a video of the day itself.

I have decided that the player for the first instance of this game will be my girlfriend, Layli. I have picked her because I think it will nicely demostrate the concept I am going for and I know her very well so can make the tasks things that she will get. Furthermore she has described her perfect day as waking up late, dicking about with me for a while, eating nice food and then having a party and I think I can do that.

## Plan
1. Build a website that dynamically exposes more and more elements of the UI throughout the course of play.
2. Think up enough tasks to fill her day.
3. Orginise a party at her house with her room mates without her knowing. This is clearly going to be the hardest part.
4. Go and ask various establishments if they will help me free of charge.
5. Figure out how to film it while not ruining the vibe.

This is the birth date of the project and I have started with the most important thing, the favicon. I dont mean to brag, but it is perfect. In less important news I have set up typescript and react strap so that next dev session I can start with everything set up and ready. I need to decide if I want to fuck with redux. We will see.

Im messaging Layli just now and she has no idea. Granted, I have only told like 2 people about this, one of whom hasnt met Layli yet and the other just got told and said she wouldnt. I wrote a plan. That was most of the last hoour and a half and Im getting bored and want to go drum.
